# DT-methods
 
This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing Decision Tree methods in Python. There are two primary implementations showcased here: a Naive Tree with if-else syntax and a Decision Tree Array-based method. These implementations can be particularly useful for various machine learning tasks and can serve as a foundational component in many predictive models.
